objects are more complex and each object may contain any combition of these primitive data types as well as reference data types. An object is a reference data type. variables that are assingned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the objects is stored. The variables don't actually store the Value
Loosely speaking, objects in Javascript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in he form of "key:value" pairs. these keys can be varibles or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
