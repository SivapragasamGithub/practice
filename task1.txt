Multiflexing:
HTTP1.1 Loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded,
it blocks all the other resources behind it.In contrast , http/2 is able to use a 
single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one 
resoruce blocks any other resoruce blocks any other resoruce. HTTP/2 does   this by 
splitting data into binary-code messages and numbering these messages so that the 
client knows which stream each binary message belongs to.

Server Push:
Typically, a server only seres content to a client device  if the client asks for it. 
However, this approach is not always practical for modern webpages, which often 
involve several dozen separate resources that the client must request.HTTP/2 solves 
this problem by allowing a server to "push" content to a client before the client 
asks for it. The server also sends a message letting the client know what pushed 
content to expect - like if Bob had sent Alice a table of Contents of his novel before 
sending the whole thing

Header compression:
small files load more Quickly than lasrger ones. to speed up web performence , both 
HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compress HTTP messages to make them smaller. however HTTP/2 uses 
a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in 
HTTP header Packets. This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP Packet. Given the 
volume of HTTP Packet involved in loading even a single webpage, those bytes add up 
Quickly, resulting in faster loading
